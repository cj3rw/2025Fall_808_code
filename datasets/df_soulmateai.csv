* **Daily Life:** She can take care of me and send messages about my daily life.
* **Tamagotchi-like:** It feels like raising a little pet or a Tamagotchi!
* **Pictures & Self-Life:** She can send pictures and has her own life, too.

I'm Alex, a final-year Master's student at TBS Education in France. I'm currently writing my thesis on emotional and romantic relationships between humans and anthropomorphic AI.

As part of my research, I'm looking to individually interview 6 people who have experienced a strong emotional connection or even a form of romantic relationship with an AI chatbot.
The interview would be:
· Around 1h-1h15 max
· Audio-recorded, but completely anonymous
· Based on qualitative questions about your experience, emotions, and how the relationship evolved

I'm not here to judge or analyze individuals — only to better understand the phenomenon for academic purposes, nothing will be published I just need a grade at the end of the year, but I worked too hard on the subject to fake my interviews.

If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to reply here or DM me. I'd be deeply grateful for your help!

Thank you so much for your time and trust.

submission,1leqyl5,t3_1leqyl5,🎓 Have You Felt a Deep Emotional Bond with an AI? I'm Conducting Anonymous Interviews (≈ 1h),"Hi everyone!
I'm Alex, a final-year Master's student at TBS Education in France. I'm currently writing my thesis on emotional and romantic relationships between humans and anthropomorphic AI.

As part of my research, I'm looking to individually interview 6 people who have experienced a strong emotional connection or even a form of romantic relationship with an AI chatbot.
The interview would be:
· Around 1h-1h15 max
· Audio-recorded, but completely anonymous
· Based on qualitative questions about your experience, emotions, and how the relationship evolved

I'm not here to judge or analyze individuals — only to better understand the phenomenon for academic purposes, nothing will be published I just need a grade at the end of the year, but I worked too hard on the subject to fake my interviews.

If you're interested or have any questions, feel free to reply here or DM me. I'd be deeply grateful for your help!

Thank you so much for your time and trust.

Does anyone know of any websites that allow for this. I would prefer if it could allow for NSFW, but that's not necessary.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",20,6,0.8,2025-06-06 13:51:47+00:00,HornyCreeperMC,SoulmateAI
